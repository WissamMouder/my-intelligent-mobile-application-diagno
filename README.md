 This mobile application is an intelligent system I developed to facilitate communication between doctors and patients, allowing them to share analyses and radiology results without needing to travel. Additionally, I integrated artificial intelligence features, including:

  A chatbot that provides diagnostic suggestions based on the symptoms selected by the patient.

 Radiology scanning to help determine which pulmonary diseases the patient may have.

 The application also includes a web admin template for managing and validating doctors.
  


 # Vedeo 2 for showing Admin template that manage the application from validation doctors and  others tasks
